# MPMOTI

We uses knowledge graph-enhanced molecular contrastive learning with functional prompts (KANO) and a custom microplastic database to predict 697 properties for approximately 350,000 MPMOTI and their isomers.

we have referred the KANO, which is proposed in a paper: Knowledge graph-enhanced molecular contrastive learning with functional prompt.
